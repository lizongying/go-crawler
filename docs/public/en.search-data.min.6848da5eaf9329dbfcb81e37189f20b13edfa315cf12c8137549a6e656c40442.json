SetCallBack(s.Parse)); err != nil { s.logger.Error(err) } } What are the ways to improve spider performance?\nTo improve the performance of the spider, you can consider disabling some unused middleware or pipelines to reduce unnecessary processing and resource consumption. Before disabling any middleware or pipeline, please assess its actual impact on the spider\u0026rsquo;s performance. Ensure that disabling any part will not have a negative impact on the functionality.\nWhy isn\u0026rsquo;t item implemented as a distributed queue?\nThe crawler processes its own items, and there is no need to handle items from other crawlers. Therefore, while the framework has reserved the architecture for distributed queues, it does not use external queues to replace the in-memory queue used by the program. If there are performance issues with processing, it is recommended to output the results to a queue.\nHow to Set the Request Priority?\nPriorities are allowed to range from 0 to 2147483647. Priority 0 is the highest and will be processed first. Currently, only Redis-based priority queues are supported.\nrequest.SetPriority(0) When will the crawler end?\nThe crawler will end and the program will close when the following conditions are met under normal circumstances:\nAll requests and parsing methods have been executed. The item queue is empty. The request queue is empty. When these conditions are fulfilled, the crawler has completed its tasks and will terminate.\nHow to prevent the spider from stopping?\nSimply return pkg.DontStopErr in the Stop method.\npackage main import \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg\u0026#34; func (s *Spider) Stop(_ pkg.Context) (err error) { err = pkg.DontStopErr return } Which should be used in the task queue: request, extra, or unique_key?\nFirstly, it should be noted that these three terms are concepts within this framework:\nrequest contains all the fields of a request, including URL, method, headers, and may have undergone middleware processing. The drawback is that it occupies more space, making it somewhat wasteful as a queue value. extra is a structured field within the request and, in the framework\u0026rsquo;s design, it contains information that can construct a unique request (in most cases). For instance, a list page under a category may include the category ID and page number. Similarly, a detail page may include a detail ID. To ensure compatibility with various languages, the storage format in the queue is JSON, which is more space-efficient. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use this option. unique_key is a unique identifier for a request within the framework and is a string. While it can represent uniqueness in some cases, it can become cumbersome when requiring a combination of multiple fields to be unique – such as in the case of list pages or detail pages involving both a category and an ID. If memory is constrained ( e.g., in Redis usage), it can be used. However, for greater generality, using extra might be more convenient. Enqueuing:\nYieldExtra or MustYieldExtra Dequeuing:\nGetExtra or MustGetExtra Whether to use Must[method], such as MustYieldRequest?\nMust[method] is more concise, but it might be less convenient for troubleshooting errors. Whether to use it depends on the individual style of the user. If there\u0026rsquo;s a need for specific error handling, then regular methods like YieldRequest should be used.\nOther\nUpgrade go-crawl Clean up cache "},{"id":21,"href":"/go-crawler/docs/docs/usage/example/","title":"Example Code","section":"Usage","content":" Example # example_spider.go\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg/app\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg/items\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg/mock_servers\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/lizongying/go-crawler/pkg/request\u0026#34; ) type ExtraOk struct { Count int } type DataOk struct { Count int } type Spider struct { pkg.Spider logger pkg.Logger } func (s *Spider) ParseOk(ctx pkg.Context, response pkg.Response) (err error) { var extra ExtraOk response.MustUnmarshalExtra(\u0026amp;extra) s.MustYieldItem(ctx, items.NewItemNone().
